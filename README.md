# Project to practice a lot of stuff

The tech used:

* React + Vite
* Typescript
* Zustand
* Tailwindcss
  
This is my very first tie using Zustand. The only reasonn I am using it because Redux Toolkit would be very overkill.
I don't know how it will go. Let's see how it goes.

## Todos

### Completed

* Fix the scroll bug -- Done.
* Make reset Board function -- Done

### Uncompleted

* Add random generator for 2 & 4 tile when site loads
* Make the rsetBoard FUnction on the store generate the board with two random tiles instead of setting them all two zeros.
* More to Come ...
