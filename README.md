# 2048 Game Clone

A clone of the classic 2048 game, built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**.

This project is a sandbox for practicing front-end skills and experimenting with modern state management in React. Itâ€™s also my first time using Zustand â€” chosen because Redux Toolkit felt like overkill for a game of this scale.

## Developer Notes

This project is a personal learning initiative to improve my front-end and state management skills. Zustand has been a surprisingly clean and simple alternative to Redux Toolkit. Compared to my previous Tic Tac Toe project where I had to awkwardly manage state through props and class objects, Zustand made shared state across components much easier to handle.

I've also used this project to build a habit of writing better READMEs, organizing my thoughts, and reflecting on what I learn. I'm journaling my full development process in a separate file.
